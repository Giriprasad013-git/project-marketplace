## After Running Migration

### Make Yourself an Admin

1. Still in the SQL Editor, run this query:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users
   SET role = 'admin'
   WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE@example.com';
   ```

2. Replace `YOUR_EMAIL_HERE@example.com` with your actual email

3. Verify it worked:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email, name, role FROM users;
   ```

---

## If You Still Get an Error

### Error: "relation 'users' does not exist"
**Solution:** Your database is empty. Run `supabase-schema-fresh.sql` instead.

### Error: "column 'role' does not exist"
**Solution:** You're running the wrong file. Make sure you're running `SAFE-MIGRATION.sql`, NOT `supabase-schema-complete.sql`

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the correct Supabase project and have admin access.

---

## Verification Steps

After the migration, run these queries to verify everything is correct:

### 1. Check if role column exists:
```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'role';
```
Should return: `role`

### 2. Check your user's role:
```sql
SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
Should show your role

### 3. List all tables:
```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```
Should show: custom_requests, payment_transactions, projects, purchases, reviews, users

## Test Your Application

1. **Log in** to your application
2. Visit **`/seller`** - Should show seller dashboard
3. Visit **`/admin`** - Should show admin panel (if you set your role to 'admin')
4. Try **creating a project** at `/seller/projects/new`
